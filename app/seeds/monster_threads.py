        subject="Deconstructing Naoki Urasawa’s Monster: a Psychological Study",
        text="""<h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Human Exploration</h2><p style="margin-left:0px;">Only a few psychologists and philosophers understand questions like what gives humans identity and what makes humans human. However, what seems to be the consensus is that humanity is important. One anime that provides insight into human nature is Naoki Urasawa’s <i>Monster</i>, an extraordinary dive. When the characters compete in a game of wits, it goes deep into the human mind.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">It took a cat-and-mouse twist, becoming one of the most “underrated” anime series of all time. People are ignored as a result of in-depth psychological studies, layered mysteries, and social comments. What makes the series faithful to the original manga so compelling is its exploration of what makes humans human. The reason is that the series also failed to tell the story of the things in the initial question.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">However, it is about what happens when an individual strips away that personality, identity, and humanity. The series takes the audience to a world between good and evil. Despite disappearing so quickly, it strives to create a realistic yet dark environment. On the other hand, it is eerily mysterious. The story centers on the genius neurosurgeon, Kenzou Tenma. He practices at the top hospitals in Germany and lives a perfect life.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">The Manifestation of Evil</h3><p style="margin-left:0px;">With Tenma’s best position and ideal fiancé, his utopian streak suddenly dissipates when he decides to save a boy, Johan Liebert. From such a point, the story slowly begins to unravel, stretching into a riveting 74-episode-long journey. Tenma aims to correct the mistake he made by appearing to save the young Liebert. In the process of uncovering a shocking truth that will change the world, his life journey, and the people he meets also begin to be affected.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">So, the audience familiar with Johan’s personality has a good idea of such character boundaries. He is the manifestation of “evil.” He watched his loyal followers die terribly while taking young children to the red-light district. Aside from that, he murdered his nanny and another elderly couple. In essence, one of his goals in life is to cheerfully destroy the individual who saved him from death.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Although he has no moral justification for his actions, he also does not care one bit about whether the person he is about to kill is guilty of anything other than offering help to the wrong person. Johan exists not because of the extraordinary love that he bears for his sister.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Johan and Anna</h3><p style="margin-left:0px;">It’s also not because of the mental anguish Johan endured throughout his childhood. Besides, it wasn’t because his sense of identity had been very unstable since he was born. Explicit and subliminal messages only weaken him. In contrast, it was not because of his loyalty to his mother’s revenge. If it’s neither sympathetic nor admirable, everything together makes it both sad and horrifying.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The recognition of the monster in him makes him a very guilty person. However, he is a product of his environment or an individual without a clear sense of self. External forces can also be the scapegoats that pervert his morality. One interpretation could be that Johan is purely a product of his environment. At the same time, his sister was also going through the same thing that he was.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Only then did he turn into a killer maniac. At first glance, Johan seems like a normal kid. He was happy until he and his sister separated from their mother. At the same time, he begins to ravage and kill people a little too quickly when thinking that way, turning him into a monster. From birth, he was trained to be an emotionless, amoral soldier, regardless of his having no impact at all on Anna Liebert, a.k.a. Nina Fortner.</p><h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Understanding Johan Liebert</h2><p style="margin-left:0px;">It’s because Nina’s childhood did not create evil in Johan. However, it merely gives shape to what was already present. In the main plot, he is so evil that he is bored with his evil and is doomed to become evil. As everyone knows, Johan is the definition of evil. What makes his character terrifying is the realism of the story. He couldn’t control someone’s mind through the use of a strange ability that only required eye contact.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Likewise, he cannot kill people using the supernatural, which only requires a name to kill its target. Rationalizations for his behavior neither exist nor seem to be beyond the understanding of the layman. What makes him truly terrifying is the banality of his methods for causing human suffering. It is not his ability to commit actual acts of violence. Apart from his charisma and mind, his true talent lies in his ability to bring out the worst in people and make them do the dirty work for him.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">He had made many serial killers across Europe work for him. While convincing people to commit suicide, he also convinced those in positions of power that he did not exist or that they did not believe him.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;">Anti-Christ</h3><p style="margin-left:0px;">Because of such things, people equate Johan more with the Anti-Christ. As with Tenma, the audience knows very little about the brutish man. Tenma’s journey is mostly about Johan’s riddle. The audience then gets a little insight into Johan’s past. Another plot twist is introduced in the series. Once again, the audience asked Johan why he did that. <i>Monster </i>is probably one of the best anime that many people haven’t watched.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">The series still manages to stand outside and above most of the others. It is because of the interesting characters and storytelling. Despite not being as flashy as most anime, many critics and fans consider Urasawa to be one of the most influential manga artists in the medium’s history. It is because of his distinctive narrative and solid style. Many people also call him the Japanese master of suspense, and not without reason.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">His works won various awards. It’s no surprise that the masterpiece by the so-called reworked mangaka is being adapted by Madhouse. Madhouse designs scene by scene without making any changes to the scenes from the manga. There’s not a single line of dialogue that the studio changes when changing it on a page-by-page basis. It is an allegiance to the source material itself; it would seem plausible to even a discerning audience.</p><h2 style="margin-left:0px;">A Perfect Adaptation</h2><p style="margin-left:0px;">However, as far as anyone is aware, such justifications are frequently lacking from studio executives. The series is as close to a perfect anime adaptation of a manga as anyone has ever seen. Additionally, <i>Monster </i>dedicates a great deal of time to its narrative through its allusions and motives. For example, the usual references are scattered throughout the story. Eva plays a sleeping beauty in the first story, while in another story, Nina’s classmate teases Johan as prince charming.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">Nina and Johan also separately claim that they are from a fairytale town. The way most of the tropes work in the series gives the characters an archetypal dimension. If not completely basic, Johan does not only act as a serial killer or brainwashing victim. Instead, he plays the monster who plays the Antichrist. Tenma wasn’t just a doctor with a heavy conscience. His strong sense of right and wrong made him a messiah in shining armor.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;">On the other hand, the series establishes itself as having a dimension that is more universal and bigger than just the criminal story of a Japanese surgeon. It becomes a typical story about the balance of evil and good without sacrificing its originality or realism.</p>

        subject='My incorrect theory on Monster by Naoki Urusawa',
        text="""3. Johan’s last mission came about after he burns the Red Rose Mansion, brings Anna there to face her as his equal, for he now has no name, and she reveals to him that his Monster was hers all along. Now faced with the truth that he was indeed nothing but the unwanted child, and now Anna knows about it, he can no longer pretend to be Anna, as she has taken her identity for herself. He is no longer The Monster With No Name given to him by Franz Bonaparta, he is only the Monster that was inside himself all along, a broken, unwanted child. Johan was content to being the Monster that Bonaparta created, but he could not cope with the fact that he was not created by Bonaparta, that he was always just an unneeded and unwanted Monster he created himself. His mother truly did not want him, his actions were all of his own volition. Johan’s last mission is then to erase Franz Bonaparta, the real monster who never acknowledged him, and finally have Tenma, the only one who did acknowledge him, kill him, being Johan’s only solace.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Johan’s final arc doesn’t take long because again, Franz Bonaparta did most of his work for him. Johan left Franz Bonaparta’s son alone due to his also being unnecessary and unwanted, he was already on Johan’s level.</strong></p><p>We have to remember that in the Red Rose Mansion, Johan comes across a portrait of what we believe to be Anna’s mother, being the name “Anna”. That is the name in Bonaparta’s poem, so that is what we assume. We see Franz draw Anna and Johan’s mother (also Anna) in a similar style and angle. In the story though they never say that they take away the woman’s name, they only take away her children’s names. When Anna and Johan’s parents’ history is revealed, we find out that their mother is not Anna, and that her name is unnecessary. If the name “Anna” is so important, then why would the author later claim it unnecessary?&nbsp;</p><p>Johan and Anna’s mother had a distinct hooked nose, unlike the portrait and unlike Anna. Bonaparta was drawing Johan and Anna’s mother to predict what Anna would look like in the future. “The mother”‘s portrait was in the room where all the men in the room were excited to see our Anna, so why would they have a picture of her mother in the room? Because that portrait was actually of Anna, not her mother. In the poem I believe “your name” is moreso the name she gave her daughter, not her name herself. If the “greatest crime” is to take away a name, and that name being Anna, I cannot reconcile that the author would throw away that important name as “unnecessary.” Franz was returning Anna’s name to her mother, the only one she actually cared about. Johan knew that Anna was the wanted child all along, that she was the intended Monster to rule the world, not Johan, but at that point he was The Monster With No Name and didn’t distinguish himself enough to be compared to his sister. When he was faced with reality that he was indeed Johan, indeed the child with a name and with the sister who had the external monster, he had to wipe out Franz Bonaparta’s small town to erase Bonaparta’s existence. Notice that he went after Bonaparta - he changed his target from people that knew Johan or his mother, and solely focused on people who knew Bonaparta, and only the small town knew him. With that he would successfully eliminate Bonaparta’s unneeding and unwanting intentions towards Johan. Johan ended up being the God of Peace, where he thought he was doing everything correct, that he was this holy child where everyone loved and wanted him to be the Monster, but when he looked in the mirror he realized he himself had the monster inside of him all along. Franz Bonaparta didn’t give it to him, Anna didn’t give it to him, his mother didn’t give it to him, he was the Real Monster all along.</p>"""

        text="""<h2><strong>Theory of Monster Anime</strong></h2><p>Monster indeed is one of the real good animes and has a deep theme pervading the entire series. I watched it sometime back however I don't have a very positive opinion of the story of the monster anime , to be frank I find it a real mess , the concept , plots , symbolism ,theme are all great no doubt , but story just goes out of the window and many things remain unexplained , there was sort of incompleteness for many things which were introduced but then left without conclusion . For example the past of twins is unclear, what happened with them is unclear as well , they have shown multiple revelation of their past multiple times but none of that adds up to explain anything about the twins , and then how the memories of twins is messed up , they have each others memory for some reason and there is explanation for that, more so up until the end ,the past of twins is inflated to be the biggest mystery and then it is left again hanging , nothing really serious happened and situation of Johan was subjective, Dr Tenma appears to be bit incoherent as well , like the series starts with showing the corruption and politics and shallow attitude of elite class which Tenma despises at first and then somewhat overlooks, all of this was not an explicit moral wrong like the one that is associated is Johan or other extremists introduced later in the series but again somewhat left hanging as in without further illustration, the irregular switch between different subjects of the anime also adds to the confusion , the employment of stream of consciousness is good but does not adds to the story. I actually like things which do not follow the convention of storyality , I actually like those innovative approaches but when done intentionally by the writers , in monsters it appears un-intensional and according to me it adds to the mess . Overall I liked the Anime . Does anyone has a theory of the initial experience of twins with citations to canon , I mean episodes , and little bit on the past of political activites mentioned in series , like what were they actually and what was the end of that.</p>

        text="""<h2><strong>Why I think Monster is the worst ending ever - RANT</strong></h2><p><strong>DO NOT READ THIS POST IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED MONSTER - MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I did enjoy monster, very much so. It was outstanding. However, the journey is what made the show, not the ending, and this is why.</p><p>This is going to be an essay. This is going to be long, strap yourself in and enjoy. After pondering on the ending that I did not like at first, I’ve come to the conclusion…heh…conclusion…something that monster lacks. I’ve pretty much determined this is one of, if not THE worst ending that I have ever seen. I am going to utterly destroy every detail about the ending and tell you exactly why it’s the worst, if you haven’t figured it out already yourself. Let’s begin.</p><p>It all goes downhill at the end of episode 73, now, correct me if I’m wrong, but the whole point of the show is about stopping the worst of all evils, Johan. You can probably tell where this is going. 70 episodes of quotes like “I’m going to end it” “this is the end” “I have to do this”. At the end of ep73 Tenma is about to pull the trigger, the time has come, this is “the end” of the story, the journey, of the monster…bang…..NOPE JOKES ITS JUST SOME RANDOM GUY OFF THE STREET (I know it’s that kids alcoholic father). The point is, it wasn’t Tenma. I would’ve been happy even if it was Nina, hell, IF A CHARACTER WE ACTUALLY KNOW DID IT. Now I kind of expected this seeing as ep39(?) Tenma or Nina didn’t do anything in the library, but come on! To bring up the old saying “fool me once, you got me (shame on you), fool me twice, shame on me”. The same applies here, TWICE we get a standoff of Tenma holding the gun at Johan and he doesn’t pull the trigger. So much build-up for nothing (although the build-up was damn good, which makes the end result seem worse).</p><p>I haven’t even scratched the surface. To continue, this is a big one, so we have Tenma ABOUT TO KILL JOHAN, LITERALLY POINTING THE GUN AT HIM &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;NEK MINNIT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HE SAVES HIM FROM THE BULLET TO THE HEAD…….AGAIN! 70 episodes of “I NEED TO END THIS” “IT HAS TO BE ME”….and when he finally DOES get shot…. <strong>OH WAIT LET ME HEAL HIM</strong>……..What.the.fuck. 70 eps of character development down the drain for Tenma, sorry bud, you learnt NOTHING. What was the point of this series again?…THAT’S RIGHT TO KILL JOHAN. I know the theme of ‘all life is equal’ is common throughout the series but when you have a monster killing life after life, this ideology becomes very unrealistic in my opinion.</p><p>And oh lord it gets worse, but I’ll continue with a slightly lesser evil after that one to give you a breather. The beginning of ep74 is fine, getting to all the characters and the resolution to their story, yay, some resolution, that’s all you’ll get here. Then, god knows why, they decide to introduce another character in the last episode…really? And to top of it off, ITS JOHAN’S AND NINA’S MOTHER. WHERE WAS SHE THROUGHOUT THE SERIES, WHY WASN’T ANYONE LOOKING FOR HER? She could have proved vital for information, they could have done a lot with this and I would’ve liked to see what they could’ve done.</p><p>The episode then moves to a scene at a hospital. Now, knowing that Tenma saved Johan at the end of ep 73 you’d think he’d be in jail ATLEAST for everything he’s done. But instead he’s still at the hospital, not handcuffed, restrained or supervised by anyone. Nice, just let the most evil of all evils lack any security on him whatsoever. Don’t worry about telling anyone, Tenma, all good. It then moves to a kind of abstract scene of Johan sitting up and telling Tenma about a specific memory. This scene HEAVILY implies that the true monster of the series is the mother who gave up the children. So that’s why they introduced the mother in the last episode, for a semi-major plot twist, ok, somewhat forgivable. But when the show has depicted Johan as a monster the whole series, this ‘twist’ doesn’t redeem his character or his actions AT ALL. It’s literally worthless information, nothing can take back what Johan has done throughout the series, he is still a monster.</p><p>Now, the mother of all plot points, the cliff-hanger of all endings, the nail in the coffin, the last 10 seconds of the series. We see, Johan, not, in, the, bed, anymore, with it being untidy, HIGHLY suggesting he has escaped, AGAIN. The series has come full circle guys. Tenma saving Johan, and Johan escaping. The whole journey, the whole 70 episodes, was utterly USELESS. We didn’t stop the monster, what was the whole point of the show again? TO KILL JOHAN, THE MONSTER…oh wait the mother is the true monster, that redeems Johan’s whole character, ALL IS GOOD, JOHAN WONT KILL ANYONE AGAIN, RIGHT?….WRONG. Do you really believe after everything you’ve seen in the show that Johan won’t kill anyone again? Don’t be ridiculous. Nothing, in my opinion, is worse than a show, movie, any piece of fiction or story that ends in a way that makes the whole journey completely USELESS. It’s the same outcome as an ending that pulls the IT WAS ALL A DREAM card.</p><p>Sigh, oh well. I’m choosing to ignore the ending, I think it’ll be much better that way, seeing as the journey, the whole show WOULD <strong>NOT</strong> BE USELESS this way.</p><p>As a final note and to remind you again, I did enjoy monster, very much so. It was outstanding. The journey is what made it (also had the best parts imo), not the ending, and that is why I am choosing to ignore it. What do you guys think of the ending? Am I completely wrong? Do you agree with me? Feel free to discuss.</p><p>Monster has taught me one thing: I now know what I’m naming my first son. ;)</p>

        subject='Guide to interpret Monster',
        text="""<h2 style="margin-left:0px;">Introduction</h2><p>When we experience a powerful work of fiction, one such as Monster, how do we know (feel) that it is deep and complex, enough to disturb us psychologically and fill us with questions? What makes Monster a masterpiece and what makes Monster hard to interpret? What do we take away from Monster and how do we know that it is the right interpretation?</p><p>A powerful experience of curious yet uncomfortable uncertainty is often found in the last panel of Monster, just an empty bed. This empty bed often jogs the brains of serious readers into wondering what it all means. After all, Monster presents itself to be a piece of fiction psychologically and philosophically rich and not understanding what an empty bed means must mean that one was missing the point. Confused, a reader would often flock to analyses of Monster, and believing that they have intellectually understood Monster, continue living their lives still psychologically disturbed because they have not truly intuitively understood Monster at all.</p><p>Welcome to a guide on how to interpret Monster (and any other pieces of fiction for that matter).</p><p>I want to discuss a few points (feel free to skip to any one of particular interest as the summary above should just suffice)</p><p><strong>1. Why Monster is a genuine and profound work of fiction, and why it is therefore hard to interpret</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style="margin-left:0px;">1. Why Monster is a genuine and profound work of fiction</h2><p>There exist many analyses of Monster, and although they vary in depth and are each unique in content, they by-and-large contain the same analysis of Monster’s message. They make the case for why Johan is not truly evil, they compare Johan with Tenma philosophically, they explore what Monster means by good and evil, etc. Many people make the observation that the reading experience of Monster is profoundly different the second time from the first. How do we make sense of this? It is simple, they exist because people often misunderstand and/or fail to understand Monster. So, what gives? Why is Monster hard, or at least, not easy to understand? Because Monster has no explicit message to be heard, to understand Monster is not to understand it intellectually and explicitly but to be understood with the heart and intuitively. How then do many posts of analyses help us understand Monster inherently and from the heart? Because Monster is eventful and intricate. Analyses of Monster are by-and-large reminders of what happens in Monster, and you cannot understand something if you do not remember it. Monster analysts pick and choose critical moments in Monster that we might have forgotten about and put them side-by-side, abridging the series down to the moments that speak most profoundly (not to say that Monster can be enjoyed through these moments alone). And to the credit of these analysts, they often do well in shining a torchlight on the heavy implications of a moment that might have passed us under the nose with the tools of mostly psychological and philosophical insights (a few linked down below).</p><p>But it can be observed that watching and reading all these analyses does not make one truly understand Monster; it helps, but it alone does not cut. Monster still has to be understood from the heart. It is time for me to explain what I mean by understanding from the heart, and to do that I will make the case for why Naoki Urasawa is a true artist (what I mean by art in this post is anything that is a work of creativity: poetry, story-writing, drawing, etc.) at heart and a great one at that.</p><p>Given the complexities of Monster, I cannot help but suspect that there is no way that Urasawa thought and created his story ‘systematically,’ for a lack of a better word, by creating a story through pre-existing character-tropes, step-by-step story-telling processes, etc. The explanation would have to be that his creative process would have to first be acknowledging the creative limitations ( restrictions on gore, story length, etc. ) while being mindful of not restricting himself to his detriment, and writing the story by ‘looking into his heart.’ To let the events play out in his head as it happens. Of course, to do this, he must already have a setting in mind, think through the core characteristics of each character, etc. It would be akin to running a simulation with clearly defined boundaries and watching the simulation unfold and writing out what you observed. Of course, there would be bad ideas here and there but through ‘survival of the fittest,’ the one that made the most sense would be inked on paper.</p><p>To do this process ‘right,’ by general definitions, one would have to be in touch with their inner unconscious and listen to it, they need to be able to develop a sense of artistic yes and no. Many people often take for granted that they very well understand the contents of their consciousness (their egos) and they take that to be self-knowledge. The knowledge that creative work taps into, however, is that of one’s unconscious contents. To understand oneself would be due to the processes of tedious self-reflection, of experiencing emotions that arrive from one’s actions and others. Creative immersion is often very helpful, as we can inherently pick up emotions and messages (implicit and/or explicit) delivered by stories to the degree that we are receptive to them. These messages that we pick up can often be found in culture, mythology, stories, etc., and within them contains the knowledge of humanity’s collective unconscious. Through these understandings, we are much more able to find and acknowledge these unconscious contents when they appear, which is what stories that run as simulations in an artist’s head appear as. When an artist is deeply in touch with their inner selves, have a good sense of story-telling, and are authentic to themselves to what comes out as a result of their simulations, they produce psychologically profound pieces of art. I would like to call Monster a masterpiece as a result of such a creative process.</p><p>There is good evidence for this. When Urasawa was interviewed on his creative process he mentioned that he would always try to be as authentic to himself as possible, to rid away of corruption ( what he thinks would sell well, other people’s expectations, etc. ) And that his process of making stories is not planning the whole story out before embarking on drawing the manga. His process was to let the stories happen inside him and he would deliberately draw the stories on paper as they happened ( sketches and drafts ). The best one survives. There can be no other authenticity than the authenticity to listen to your own heart. He was also obviously a creative person, (he had good aesthetic sense, drew art, played music, wrote fiction, etc.) (*It is should be of interest to note that he is a very creative person, and is therefore more receptive to grasp the collective unconscious and his inner self, skip to section 4: 'Understanding Personality' linked 'Openness to Experience' to find out more) and he had a huge interest in consuming and making art, which would allow him a deep understanding of the collective unconscious which would roughly translate into a deeper self-understanding (note that I used the word ‘roughly’) There can be no greater profoundness than profoundness that speaks to people’s hearts (the collective unconscious).</p><blockquote><p>Urasawa himself said in an interview: “When I start a new project, I start with the larger arc of the story. I visualise a movie trailer for that story, and after I compose this movie trailer in my mind, there comes a point where I’m so excited about it that I have to write the story. And then I imagine, “Where do I start to begin to tell this narrative?” and that’s usually the first chapter. Once this process starts, the story tells me where it wants to go next. I think if I tried to design a manga with each detail of the story planned out from the beginning, or tried to deliver a story where everything happens according to plan, there’s no way I could create something that would last five to seven years. Every time the story pulls me in a new or unexpected direction, even I’m surprised. If the story of the manga doesn’t keep surprising me, I wouldn’t be able to continue making it. There might be a scene I envision as I begin the project, something from that trailer I’ve visualised, but that scene might show up five years later as I’m illustrating the manga.”</p></blockquote><p>A great way to sniff out disingenuous art is to look for clear and explicit messaging. To take the example of disingenuous story-writing for example, a writer would start writing a story with an end in mind or a clear message that they want to express (propaganda). They would often straw-man opposing viewpoints (and therefore virtue-signal), by attaching them to negative characters. E.g. Innocent sweetheart (Pure good) vs Money-loving corrupt boss (Pure-evil). One should notice that the reason why Monster is hard to interpret is that there is no explicit messaging. Every character and what they stand for are iron-manned, they make good cases for themselves and what they represent to us. Like us, the characters in Monster evolve– old, bad ideas die out and characters are reborn as better people. To sieve out the wheat from the chaff would require work on the part of the readers. To do so effectively would require critical thinking and critical self-reflection. (Similar to the process of making genuine art). Understanding one’s unconscious and the collective unconscious is key.</p>
